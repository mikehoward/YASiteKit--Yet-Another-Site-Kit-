<p><strong>Category</strong> objects are used to create a hierarchic structure of tags or classifications.
This module also provides an interface to the Session object (<a href="/doc.d/system-includes/session.html">see</a>)</p>

<p>Most category operations do not directly use the Category classes but rather use
<em>category</em> data types which are defined in <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aclass.html#category">aclass.php</a></p>

<p>Read the next section in order to find out how to use them. Read the following for a detailed
discussion of Category objects.</p>

<h2>How to Use Categories</h2>

<h3>Classifying with Sub-Categories</h3>

<p>First of all, you use can Categories to put AnInstance subclasses into one or more
classifications.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a newsletter, so we set up a &#8216;top level&#8217; category called &#8216;_newsletter&#8217;.
We can add a bunch of subcategories, such as &#8216;_newsletter_latest&#8217;, &#8216;_newsletter_jan2010&#8217;,
and things like that.</p>

<p>To do this, we&#8217;ll create a Newsletter object by extending
<a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aclass.html#aninstance">AnInstance</a>. One of the attributes will
have the name <em>category</em> and will have the type &#8216;category(<em>newsletter</em>)&#8217;. This
will automatically classify every Newsletter object as a member of the <em>newsletter</em>
category.</p>

<p>Every AnInstance extension &#8211; Newsletter in our case &#8211; has several &#8216;support&#8217; methods
which interface with Category objects. We&#8217;ll look at them first before we start
looking at Category methods.</p>

<p>First of all, when we create a new Newsletter instance, we probably want to assign
it to a few categories. For example we might want one for the month and year and and
another for the year alone and maybe a few for special topics. The easiest way to
do this is to assign a bunch of categories to the <em>category</em> attribute. So we
might write something which does:</p>

<pre>$this-&gt;category = '_newsletter_y2010,_newsletter_jun2010,_newsletter_special'
</pre>

<p>This will replace the current set of categories by the comma separated list show &#8211; plus the root category of &#8216;_newsletter&#8217;.</p>

<p>If you want to add or delete categories individually, you will use the <em>add_category()</em>
and <em>delete_category()</em> methods. For example to make this Newsletter the latest,
you could write:</p>

<pre>$this-&gt;add_category('category', '_newsletter_latest');
</pre>

<p>But this would result in two <em>latest</em> newsletters unless you find the current
newsletter and write:</p>

<pre>$latest_newsletter-&gt;delete_category('category', '_newsletter_latest');
</pre>

<p>The easiest way to get the latest newsletter object is to use a Category class method:</p>

<pre>$latest_newsletter = Category::get_instances_for_category('_newsletter_latest', $this-&gt;dbaccess, 'Newsletter');
</pre>

<p>Then &#8211; of course &#8211; you can add categories at will.</p>

<h3>Using Categories to Relate Objects</h3>

<p>An additional feature is that if objects of different types &#8211; say Products and Deliverables &#8211; share the same Categories, then it&#8217;s easy to manage them.</p>

<p>The YASiteKit system has both a Product and a Deliverable class. The Product class
defines the content of a product &#8211; say an image or book content. The Deliverable
class defines the format of the deliverable &#8211; say a print, electronic pdf, engraving,
etc.</p>

<p>Both classes have a <em>deliverable_category</em> attribute. As an example, let&#8217;s assume
we have set up the following deliverable categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>_deliverable &#8211; the root of all deliverables</li>
</ul>

<p>For deliverable formats which are free</p>

<ul>
<li>_deliverable_freedownload &#8211; the root of all free products and product samples</li>
<li>_deliverable_freedownload_image &#8211; free downloadable images</li>
<li>_deliverable_freedownload_sw &#8211; free downloadable software</li>
<li>_deliverable_freedownload_report &#8211; free downloadable reports</li>
</ul>

<p>And for deliverables which are for sale:</p>

<ul>
<li>_deliverable_image &#8211; images</li>
<li>_deliverable_image_download &#8211; images download</li>
<li>_deliverable_image_print &#8211; physical print of an image</li>
<li>_deliverable_sw &#8211; software</li>
<li>_deliverable_sw_download &#8211; downloadable software delivery</li>
<li>_deliverable_sw_physical &#8211; packaged software</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose we have &#8211; as is often the case &#8211; software for sale which operates in both
a licensed and trial mode. Then we for the product, we will probably have a line
of code which looks like:</p>

<pre>$this-&gt;deliverable_category = '_deliverable_freedownload_sw,_deliverable_sw_download,_deliverable_sw_physical';
</pre>

<p>When we want to retrieve a list of all the Deliverable objects which relate to this product,
we will use the <em>select_objects_in_category()</em> method of the Product class:</p>

<pre>$deliverables = $this-&gt;select_objects_in_category('deliverable_category', 'Deliverable');
</pre>

<p>We can then create a shopping cart style menu which displays the product information and
all deliverables which are appropriate.</p>

<p>Notice that we can change the deliverable mix without modifying the program by using
Deliverable and Product management.</p>

<p>If we want to dress up our item menu a little, we can use the <em>category_paths_of()</em>
and <em>category_objects_of()</em> to retrieve all the Categories [either path name only or
entire objects] for any <em>category</em> attribute. This makes it easy to write code
which describes the general types of deliverables which are available for any given
product.</p>

<h3>Category Class Methods</h3>

<p>The Category class methods are described in boring-ease below. Here we concentrate
on when you might want to use them.</p>

<ul>
<li>get_instances_for_category(category, dbaccess, class-name) &#8211; this is useful if you
need to find instancs of <em>class-name</em> objects in a category specific category or
in a different database or something like that. Mostly you <em>won&#8217;t</em> use this because
the AnInstance <em>select_objects_in_category()</em> is what you want.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>add_to_category() and delete_from_category() &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t be used directly. Use the
AnInstance support methods instead because they manage the instance bookeeping for
your AnInstance derived object. The Category add and delete methods only manage
the category objects and join tables.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>categories_for_instance() &#8211; gets all the categories a specific instance is in.
It does not restrict the list by attribute &#8211; not surprisingly. The return is an array
of category paths. It may be useful in some cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Category Objects</h2>

<p>Each Category object is represented by a sequence of tokens which are connected
by the underscore (_) character. This string is called the category <em>path</em>.
This is similar to <span class="caps">UNIX</span> path names. [The
underscore was chosen so that the category name satisfies the <span class="caps">PHP</span> identifier
construction rules &#8211; which makes many things much easier.]</p>

<h3>Path Name Syntax</h3>

<p>Each token must satisfy [a-z0&#8211;9]{1,15} &#8211; lower case letters and digits.
Thus, each token may be at most 15 characters long.</p>

<p>The rightmost segment of a <em>path</em> is called the <em>name</em>.</p>

<p>If a <em>path</em> contains an underscore, then the string to the
left of the rightmost underscore is a path and is called the
<em>parent</em>. If it does not contain an underscore, then the <em>path</em>
is a &#8216;top level&#8217; path and it&#8217;s parent is empty &#8211; or the &#8216;root&#8217;
category &#8211; which is represented by the empty string (&#8217;&#8217;).
The &#8216;root&#8217; category can never be instantiated.</p>

<p>Some examples of legal paths:</p>

<pre>
foo - the immediate child of the root category with name 'foo'
foo_bar - name _bar_, parent _foo_
foo_bar_baz - name _baz_, parent _foo_bar_
</pre>

<h4>Children and Subpaths</h4>

<p>Each Category may have zero or more sub-categories represented by <em>subpath</em>
strings. A <em>subpath</em> of a <em>path</em> is a legal path string which consists
of <em>path</em> followed by a connecting underscore (_) and another legal path string.</p>

<p>Thus, if <em>foo</em> is a path, then <em>foo_bar</em> and <em>foo_baz_beez</em> are both
<em>subpaths</em> of <em>foo</em> and <em>bar_foo</em> is not.</p>

<p>If a <em>subpath</em> of <em>path</em> consists of <em>path</em> conjoined to a single <em>token</em>,
then <em>subpath</em> is a <em>child</em> of <em>path</em> (also called a <em>direct child</em> or
<em>direct descendent</em>). Otherwise, it is a <em>descendent</em>.</p>

<p>In the above examples, the subpath <em>foo_bar</em> of <em>foo</em> is a <em>child</em>,
wherease <em>foo_baz_beez</em> is a descendent, but not a child.</p>

<h4>Membership Implementation</h4>

<p>Membership in a category is implemented using AJoin objects to join
Category instances to other instances of classes derived from AnInstance.</p>

<p>The Category class supports primatives to associate other AClass objects
with specific categories, disassiocate them and retrieve lists of objects
&#8216;in a category&#8217;.</p>

<p>The Category class also supports default categories.
This is
implemented by interfacing with the <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/session.html">Session</a>
object. See <a href="#session_interface">below</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Instantiation</h3>

<pre>$cat = new Category(dbaccess, arg), where _arg_ can be:
</pre>

<ul>
<li>an array defining the keys <em>parent</em> and <em>name</em>.</li>
<li>a category name of the form &#8216;foo_bar&#8217; &#8211; as described above.</li>
<li>a string of the form <em>name</em>, which recreates a top level category which is
a child of the (nameless) root category.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instance Attributes</h3>

<ul>
<li>path &#8211; string &#8211; the underscore separated names of all category tokens
from &#8216;root&#8217; to the</li>
<li>parent &#8211; string (read only) &#8211; underscore (_) separated names of all ancestor categories.</li>
<li>name &#8211; string (read only) &#8211; name for this category. Must be unique within the parent</li>
<li>sibling_ordinal &#8211; int &#8211; order of sorting within parent. Must be monotonically increasing within
a parent</li>
<li>title &#8211; string &#8211; visible title</li>
</ul>

<h3>Class Methods</h3>

<p>Theses Class methods support category mapulation for instances of other objects.
This is implemented by defining AJoin objects between Category and other
objects.</p>

<p>In these methods, <em>category</em> must be an appropriate key which can
be used to instantiate a Category object (see above). Instance is the instance
of the class we want to join the category to.</p>

<ul>
<li>Category::add_to_category(category, instance) &#8211; adds instance and category to the
AJoin table for <em>category</em>. Recursively adds all antecedents of <em>category</em>.</li>
<li>Category::delete_from_category(category, instance) &#8211; Deletes AJoin entries
for <em>instance</em> and <em>category</em> and all descendents of <em>category</em> from AJoin
table.</li>
<li>Category::get_instances_for_category(category, dbaccess, aclass_name) &#8211; returns an array of all object instances joined to the specified <em>category</em>
which are <em>aclass_name</em> objects in database <em>dbaccess</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Category::categories_for_instance(instance) &#8211; returns an array of category
names for the specified instance. <em>instance</em> can be an class deriveed from
AnInstance.</li>
</ul>

<p>General Stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category::subpath_of_pathP($subpath, $path) &#8211; returns <span class="caps">TRUE</span> if <em>$subpath</em>
is a subpath of <em>$path</em>, but not equal to <em>$path</em>. Otherwise, returns <span class="caps">FALSE</span>.</li>
<li>Category::subpath_of_path_groupP($subpath, $path_group) &#8211; returns <span class="caps">TRUE</span>
if <em>$subpath</em> is a subpath of any member of <em>$path_group</em>. <em>$path_group</em> can
be empty, a string of zero or more comma separated Category paths, or an
array of Category paths.</li>
<li>Category::options_elt_for_category(dbaccess, parent = &#8217;&#8217;, select_list = <span class="caps">NULL</span>, deep = <span class="caps">FALSE</span>) &#8211; returns an <span class="caps">HTML</span> options string for all children (or descendents if <em>deep</em> is <span class="caps">TRUE</span>)
of <em>parent</em>. <em>parent</em> defaults to the root category. <em>select_list</em> may be empty,
a single category path string, or an array of paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Session Support:
Each Category with children may have a <em>default</em> child stored in the session.
The session interface consists of two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category::set_default_category(parent_path, sub_path) &#8211; sets _sub_path as the
default sub-path for <em>parent_path</em> in the session store.</li>
<li>Category::get_default_category(parent_path) &#8211; gets the default sub-category of <em>parent_path</em> from the
session store. Returns a Category instance or <span class="caps">FALSE</span> if the default is not set.</li>
</ul>

<!--
* Category::select_elt_for_instance(instance, category, other_class, name_of_select, multi = FALSE) -
returns an HTML select element which can be used in a form. The _name_of_select_
is the name of the select element. Values for options are urlencoded key values.
The display text is default display field for the object.
-->

<h3>Instance Methods</h3>

<p>Category Support:</p>

<ul>
<li>children() &#8211; returns a list of all immediate children of <em>this</em></li>
<li>descendents(include_self = <span class="caps">FALSE</span>) &#8211; returns a list of all descendents of <em>this</em>.
If <em>include_self</em> is <span class="caps">TRUE</span>, then the array includes <em>this</em></li>
<li>antecedients(include_self = <span class="caps">FALSE</span>) &#8211; like descendents(), but goes upward.</li>
</ul>

<p>Form support:</p>

<ul>
<li>options_elt_for_category($dbaccess, $selected_list = <span class="caps">NULL</span>, $parent = &#8217;&#8217;) &#8211; returns options elements for all children of <em>$parent</em></li>
<li>table_of_categories($parent = <span class="caps">NULL</span>) &#8211; <span class="caps">WARNING</span> &#8211; only used by the Category management
form.
Returns an <span class="caps">HTML</span> table of all category data
for the supplied <em>parent</em> or all Category instances. ManageCategory.php has some
javascript which supports easy manipulation of the sort order within parents</li>
<li>process_form() &#8211; overrides the default AnInstance::process_form() method in order
to provide special functioning for Category objects. (See
<a href="http://doc.d/system-includes/aclass.html">aclass.php</a> for general details)</li>
</ul>

<p>Misc</p>

<ul>
<li>delete() &#8211; overrides the default AnInstance <em>delete()</em> method to handle some special
stuff for categories. Relies on parent::delete() to actually do the delete and on
AnInstance::delete_category_references(). This method screws up synchronization between
any effected AnInstance subclass instance which is in memory. You should not trust
them after running <em>delete()</em>, so you should either terminate processing the <span class="caps">HTML</span>
request OR regenerate any instances you need to mess with. Of course you only have
to do this with AnInstance subclasses which contain <em>category</em> attributues.</li>
