<h1>YATheme &#8211; Yet Another Theme Hack (revision 4)</h1>

<p>YATheme is a minimally intrusive, caching theme system designed to complement and augment
<span class="caps">PHP</span>. It does not replace any <span class="caps">PHP</span> functionality.</p>

<p>YATheme provides three features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexible, content driven templating</li>
<li>Convenient and automatic <span class="caps">PHP</span> variable testing</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>

<p>The system consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>language</strong> which is embedded in mixed <span class="caps">PHP</span> &amp; <span class="caps">HTML</span> &#8211; <a href="#language">described here</a></li>
<li>a language <strong>compiler</strong> which identifies the YATheme constructs
and translates them into <span class="caps">PHP</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> &#8211; <a href="#compiler">sketched here</a></li>
<li>a content-file driven <strong>template system</strong> &#8211; described <a href="#templates">below</a></li>
<li>a configurable <strong>caching system</strong> &#8211; <a href="#cache">go here</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="clear:both;" id="structure">Page Structure</h2>

<p>The <strong>YATheme</strong> system makes page construction a little unusual.</p>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-0.jpg"><img src="img/YATemplateOverview-0.jpg" style="width:20%;border:solid black 1px;float:right;" title="conventional template" alt="conventional template" class="right" /></a></p>

<p><span class="caps">HTML</span> pages are normally thought of as being constructed &#8216;top down&#8217; because that is
how they are processed by the Web Browser. This is also the way that we normally
them and how we visualize writing them.</p>

<p>In a templated site, we still tend to think &#8216;top down&#8217; &#8211; at least from the point
of view of the template. We think of the content as &#8216;being inserted&#8217; into the
template &#8211; which provides an appropriate environment for the content to be rendered.</p>

<p>When creating pages using a mixture of <span class="caps">PHP</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span>, we still tend to think in the
same way.</p>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-2.jpg"><img src="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-2.jpg" style="width:20%;clear:both;border:solid black 1px;float:right;" title="YATheme templates" alt="YATheme templates" class="right" /></a></p>

<p><strong>YATheme</strong> requires a slightly different point of view.</p>

<p>As in any templated system, we create template files and fragments which will
create a context for the content, but we expect certain data to be defined
by the content file. Data such as page titles, headers, selection of appropriate
menus and navigation structures. Possibly altered <span class="caps">CSS</span> to convey content contextual
information, etc.</p>

<p>While this data must be defined in the content file, it <em>must</em> occur in proper
sequence in the final page file which is rendered by the browser.</p>

<p><strong>YATheme</strong> provides mechanisms to specify the values of various data which will
be placed in proper sequence in the content file.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="caps">PHP</span> initialization code which will be placed at the beginning of the file
to ensure that all variables which must be defined <em>prior</em> to the rendering
of the actual content are defined and available &#8211; such as page headings, titles,
etc. See <a href="#phpprefix"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Prefix</a> for details of how this is done.</li>
<li>Meta tags and <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript links can be defined in content and arbitrary
include files and then independently formatted under the control of the template.
See <a href="#meta">Meta, <span class="caps">CSS</span> &amp; Javascript</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="language">YATheme Language</h2>

<p>YATheme Language constructs are all enclosed in <strong>y-braces</strong>: <strong>&#8217;{:&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8217;:}&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<p>YATheme escapes consist of four types:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="caps">PHP</span> Variable references. These consist of a single <span class="caps">PHP</span> variable enclosed in <strong>y-braces</strong> and
optionally followed by default value. If the default value is present, then it is separated
from the variable by a pipe symbol (|). The default value is evaluated as literal text;
any enclosed <span class="caps">PHP</span> code will not do what you want it to do.
<ol>
<li>{: $foo :}</li>
<li>{: ClassName::$foo | the static variable ClassName::$foo is not defined :}</li>
<li>{: $foo | this does not initialize $foo: <?php echo ($foo = 'some value'); ?>}</li>
<li>{: ClassName::$foo->$bar[&#8216;foo&#8217;][$x]->foo | this messy variable isn&#8217;t defined. Use &#8216;test&#8217; to see what the problem is:}</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span class="caps">PHP</span> Prefix Code. This is initialization code which must be executed first in the
rendering of the resulting web page. See <a href="#phpprefix"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Prefix</a> for details.</li>
<li>Commands. These control the construction of the page and various other things.
See <a href="#commands">Commands</a> for detailed descriptions of each of the following commands:
<ol>
<li>errors &#8211; specifies how detected errors are to be handled. Can also be set programmatically</li>
<li>guards &#8211; turns in-line testing of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> variables on and off</li>
<li>include &#8211; includes a specified file into the resulting file. This is implicitly recursive
because the file is processed.</li>
<li>test &#8211; inserts code to test a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> variable. This is useful if a complex variable is not
defined. <em>test</em> parses the variable into component parts and writes a test for each one.
The result is wrapped in an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> div element with class <em>yatheme-test</em></li>
<li>yatheme &#8211; turns the YATheme parsing on and off &#8211; useful in developing web pages when
there is a bug in the YATheme code</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Metadata, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and Javascript &#8211; these commands allow metadata tags and css and javascript
links to be defined in several different places and then finally rendered in the template
at a single location. See <a href="#meta">Meta, <span class="caps">CSS</span> &amp; Javascript</a> for details.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="commands">YATheme Commands</h3>

<h4>errors &lt;normal&gt;</h4>

<p>specifies how detected errors are to be handled. Can also be set programmatically</p>

<p><strong>{:errors normal:}</strong> &#8211; results in <span class="caps">PHP</span> errors being displayed on the screen. This is good
for development and alpha testing</p>

<p><strong>{:errors ignore:}</strong> &#8211; results in errors being discarded. I&#8217;m not sure if this is good
for anything</p>

<p><strong>{:errors email <em>email address</em>:}</strong> &#8211; results in errors being emailed to the supplied
email address. This is good for production sites.</p>

<h4>guards &lt;on&gt;</h4>

<p>turns in-line testing of <span class="caps">PHP</span> variables on and off.</p>

<p><strong>{:guards on:}</strong> &#8211; results in each <strong>{:$variable:}</strong> being replaced by</p>

<pre>&lt;?php echo (isset($variable) ? $variable : "\$variable is not set"); ?&gt;
</pre>

<p>and <strong>{:$variable | default value:}</strong> by</p>

<pre>&lt;?php echo (isset($variable) ? $variable : 'default value'); ?&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>{:guards off:}</strong> &#8211; simply results in replacing <strong>{:$variable:}</strong> by</p>

<pre>&lt;?php echo $variable; ?&gt;
</pre>

<h4>include path</h4>

<p>includes a specified file into the resulting file. This is implicitly recursive
because the file is processed.</p>

<p><strong>{:include <em>path</em>:}</strong> &#8211; as in {:include foo/bar.tpl:}</p>

<h4>test <em>variable</em></h4>

<p>inserts code to test a <span class="caps">PHP</span> variable. This is useful if a complex variable is not
defined. <em>test</em> parses the variable into component parts and writes a test for each one.
The result is wrapped in an <span class="caps">HTML</span> div element with class <em>yatheme-test</em>.</p>

<p><strong>{:test <em>variable</em>:}</strong></p>

<h4>yatheme &lt;on&gt;</h4>

<p>Turns the YATheme parsing on and off &#8211; useful in developing web pages when
there is a bug in the YATheme code</p>

<p><strong>{:yathem on:}</strong> &#8211; turns on YATheme processing. This is &#8216;normal mode&#8217;</p>

<p><strong>{:yatheme off:}</strong> &#8211; turns YATheme processing. This passes all YATheme escapes
through as literal <span class="caps">HTML</span> text.</p>

<h3 id="phpprefix"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Prefix &amp; Setup</h3>

<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> Setup and Prefix code is <span class="caps">PHP</span> code which is run prior to the DocType tag
at the top of the web page. Each file which is rendered &#8211; main content, include
files, and templates &#8211; may independently define these blocks of code.</p>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-4.jpg"><img src="img/YATemplateOverview-4.jpg" style="width:20%;border:solid black 1px;float:right;" title="php prefix construction" alt="php prefix construction" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>The choice between <em>setup</em> and <em>prefix</em> forms depends on precisely where you
need to run the code. The <em>setup</em> and <em>prefix</em> are like the top and bottom pieces
of bread in a sandwich. Between them is the prefix content of all include files
which are included in <em>this</em> specific file. The <em>setup</em> is on top, and the <em>prefix</em>
is on the bottom.</p>

<p>The syntax of both blocks is similar:</p>

<pre>*{:php-prefix:}* PHP code without any enclosing PHP escapes *{:end-php-prefix:}*
</pre>

<pre>*{:php-setup:}* PHP code without any enclosing PHP escapes *{:end-php-setup:}*
</pre>

<p>That takes care of a single file and it&#8217;s include files.</p>

<p>The situation is a little more complex, but well defined, for content embedded
in templates.</p>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-3.jpg"><img src="img/YATemplateOverview-3.jpg" style="width:20%;border:solid black 1px;float:right;" title="php prefix construction" alt="php prefix construction" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>See the picture on the right for a visualization of how <span class="caps">PHP</span> prefix blocks are used to
construct the final <span class="caps">PHP</span> prefix. The ordering allows content files to have the final
control over the environment by allowing them to define the last initialization code
which is executed.</p>

<p>In detail: for each file which goes into building the page, all the php prefix blocks
from all included files (which recursively includes their includes, etc) are concatenated
in the order included along with the files <em>setup</em> and <em>prefix</em> blocks, as described
above.
Finally, if this file acts as a template by including content, the entire php prefix
defined in the content file is added on the end.</p>

<p>The entire block is wrapped in a <span class="caps">PHP</span> escape and prefixed to the rendering of the file.</p>

<h3 id="meta">Meta, <span class="caps">CSS</span> &amp; Javascript</h3>

<p>Meta, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript are supported by <strong>seven</strong> commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>{:meta name content:}</strong> &#8211; declares a meta tag. The tag will either be of the
form &lt;meta name=&#8220;name&#8221; content=&#8220;content&#8221; &gt; or &lt;meta http-equiv=&#8220;name&#8221; content=&#8220;content&#8221;&gt;,
depending on the value of <em>name</em>.</li>
<li><strong>{:css path:}</strong> or <strong>{:css path media:}</strong> &#8211; specifies that <em>path</em> is the source
of an external <span class="caps">CSS</span> file. If <em>media</em> is not specified, then <em>all</em> is used. <em>media</em>
can be anything &#8211; but it is a good idea that it be a legal <span class="caps">CSS</span> 2 media type or
<span class="caps">CSS</span> 3 media query. It is copied as written into the <em>link</em> element.</li>
<li><strong>{:javascript path:}</strong> &#8211; specifies that <em>path</em> is the source of an external
Javascript file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Embedding <span class="caps">HTML</span> <em>&lt;style&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;script&gt;</em> elements is effected by
wrapping the content in <em>style</em> and <em>script</em> YATheme commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>{:style:} css statements w/o script tags{:end-style:}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{:script:} javascript without script tags{:end-script:}</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The actual <span class="caps">HTML</span> elements are created by the <strong>render</strong> command:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>{:render css:}</strong> &#8211; is replaced by links to all the defined <span class="caps">CSS</span> files</li>
<li><strong>{:render meta:}</strong> &#8211; is replaced by rendering of all Meta tags which have been
defined.</li>
<li><strong>{:render javascript:}</strong> &#8211; does what you expect for Javascript Script elements.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rendering of meta, css, and javascript entries is the <em>last</em> thing process performed
in page rendering. It is effected by replacing all occurances of {:render meta:} by
the illegal YATheme token: &#8217;{:-meta-:}&#8217;. Similarly for css and javascript.</p>

<p><span class="caps">WARNING</span>: don&#8217;t put in more than one {:render&#8230;:} for each. We do not check this, yet.</p>

<h4>Order of Rendering Meta, <span class="caps">CSS</span> &amp; Javascript</h4>

<p>First of all, it works pretty much the way you want it to. So, if you don&#8217;t want
to go through the mess, don&#8217;t worry about it &#8211; unless something bad is happening.</p>

<p>Second, rendering order depends on the order in which the command occur and the arrangement
of file inclusion / template referencing. [a file include is when <span class="caps">THIS</span> file includes
<span class="caps">THAT</span> file; a template <span class="caps">REFERENCE</span> is when <span class="caps">THIS</span> file inserts itself into <span class="caps">THAT</span> file]</p>

<p>As in <em>php-setup</em> and <em>php-prefix</em> blocks, each file gathers up its meta, css, and
javascript into separate arrays while parsing the file.
[css and javascript arrays are guaranteed to have a unique
set of entries. If a duplicated entry is found, the <em>earlier</em> one is discarded: this
preserves the precedence inherit in the cascade of definitions of both <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript].</p>

<p>When a file is included, it&#8217;s definitions are automatically appended to the arrays.</p>

<p>When a template file is referenced, all of these definitions are appended to the Template
file definitions. Then, when the template is rendered, the modified definitions are
rendered in the proper order &#8211; with the inner-most content definitions <em>last</em>.</p>

<p>All this works because the definitions are gathered during the parsing phase and rendered
during the <em>render</em> phase. This gives us a place to tinker with template definitions.</p>

<h2 id="templates">Template Overview</h2>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-1.jpg"><img src="img/YATemplateOverview-1.jpg" style="width:20%;border:solid black 1px;margin-bottom:10px;float:right;vertical-align:middle;" title="conventional template" alt="conventional template" class="right middle" /></a></p>

<p>Conventional templates are hierarchic: they normally are defined by a <em>template</em> file
which includes various other sub-files &#8211; including the content.</p>

<p><a href="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-2.jpg"><img src="/doc.d/img/YATemplateOverview-2.jpg" style="width:20%;clear:both;border:solid black 1px;margin-top:10px;float:right;vertical-align:middle;" title="YATheme templates" alt="YATheme templates" class="right middle" /></a></p>

<p><strong>YATheme</strong> templates are not hierarchic: the content file typically choses a <em>template</em>
file in which to embed itself.</p>

<p>A <strong>YATheme</strong> template file is any file which contains the <strong>{:yatemplate-content:}</strong> YATheme escape.
Generally only one such escape will be present, but if you want to include a bunch,
it&#8217;s legal and will do what you expect it will do: multiple renderings of the content.</p>

<p>Any file may reference any template file by including the <strong>{:yatemplate file-name:}</strong>
escape, where <em>file-name</em> is the name of a template file living somewhere on the include
path. If more than one of these escapes occurs, then only the last one is used.</p>

<p>Templates can embed themselves in another template (see picture on right),
so the entire thing can get out of hand easily. Ont the other hand, this
feature also makes it relatively easy to build something
analogous to Object Inheritance using YATheme templates.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;" id="cache">Caching System</h2>

<p>The Caching system is implemented as a <span class="caps">PHP</span> object which extends the
<a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aninstance.html">AnInstance</a> class. It also
automatically provides access to the language compiler and rendering
functions, as needed. There is never any need to access the compiler
directly (unless you want to).</p>

<p>The object is described in the <a href="/doc.d/system-objects/YATheme.html">YATheme.php</a>
documentation.</p>

<p>Caching is provided at three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>on &#8211; normal caching. Fully rendered pages are saved in the database table
<em>yatheme</em>. They are only parsed and re-rendered if they are missing.
This is good for Alpha level sites.</li>
<li>compress &#8211; same as <em>on</em> except that pages are passed through the <span class="caps">PHP</span> function
<em>php_strip_whitespace()</em> prior to saving them. This removes all extra white
space (and comments) from the <span class="caps">PHP</span> parts of the file &#8211; making the request responses
somewhat smaller. This is good for Production sites.</li>
<li>off &#8211; every page is reassembled, parsed, and rendered for each request.
This is good for development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compiler">Language Compiler and Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The language compiler is implemented using several objects defined in three
files:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/doc.d/system-includes/athemer.html">athemer.php</a> &#8211; which defines the language grammar
and implements the support structure for the parser and lexical scanner. It defines
the YAThemeParser object, which is the primary object used to translate mixed
<span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, and YATheme into mixed <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">PHP</span></li>
<li><a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aparser.html">aparser.php</a> &#8211; a top-down, recursive programmable
parser modeled very loosely after yacc and bison. This defines the AParser object
which &#8211; given a language definition and lexical scanner &#8211; implements a recursive
descent parser. Parsers implemented using this object must be right recursive and
written so that the most complex productions are examined before simpler productions.
See the documentation. (this parser is written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, so it runs in <span class="caps">PHP</span> time &#8211; which
is not necessarily all that efficient, but is much more portable than a C implementation).</li>
<li><a href="/doc.d/system-includes/ascanner.html">ascanner.php</a> &#8211; a programmable lexical
scanner. Also written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, this is used to reduce files to a sequence of tokens
which AParser objects can digest. It&#8217;s a little strange, but works quite well.
Suitably defined rules execute quite rapidly.</li>
