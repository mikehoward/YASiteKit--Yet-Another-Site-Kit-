<h1>Cookie-Wrangling &#8211; the Art of knowing what&#8217;s going on</h1>

<p>YASiteKit uses cookies to maintain (relatively) secure
session data. It also uses cookies to maintain a relationship with users
between sessions.</p>

<p>In fact, we&#8217;re so dependent on cookies, YASiteKit sites won&#8217;t run without them.</p>

<p>Also, we like to run with Javascript on. We like that so much we <em>require</em> it
for administrative work &#8211; Admin, Staff, Vendors, etc. Clients don&#8217;t have to
turn on Javascript, but they are losing out.</p>

<p>So, we need to know if the client is cooperating. It turns out that&#8217;s not easy.</p>

<h2>Possible Client States</h2>

<p>There are four possible client states we are interested in:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Cookies</td>
<td>Javascript</td>
<td>Results In . . .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Good &#8211; everything works fine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Bad &#8211; we can maintain state, but the session isn&#8217;t secure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Medium Poor &#8211; Secure session but not-so-snazzy Site. We don&#8217;t put up with this for admin accounts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Disgusting &#8211; we have insecure sessions and a Web 0.5 site</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>What we&#8217;ll put up with</h2>

<p>Anyone with an Account &#8211; Admins, Staff, Artists, etc &#8211; <em>must</em> enable both
Cookies and Javascript. If they don&#8217;t like it, they can just take their
ball and go home.</p>

<p>End of Story.</p>

<p>For &#8216;non-privileged users&#8217; &#8211; the really important people who may actually want to
use the site for something (like buy some stuff) we will put up with no Javascript,
but we&#8217;re not comfortable selling them stuff &#8211; or getting any sensitive information &#8211; without a secure session.</p>

<p>[Just to be clear: by &#8216;secure session&#8217; we&#8217;re not talking about an encrypted connection.
That is a good thing, but a secure session can <em>only</em> be implemented using cookies.
Even if you&#8217;re running <span class="caps">SSL</span>, you&#8217;re insecure if you put the session id in the Query String.
We&#8217;re making the unjustified assumption that the bulk of session hijacking will be done
by inspecting query strings &#8211; from logs, spoofing, physhing or network snooping of some
sort &#8211; so we&#8217;re not concerned about <span class="caps">SSL</span> <em>here</em>. That&#8217;s for later]</p>

<p>If we allow sessions without Cookies, then we have to accept that we are
<em>allowing sessions which can be hijacked</em>.</p>

<p>YASiteKit Central has decided that this is not acceptable. [it also turns out to
be too hard to deal with]</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what finally pushed us over that edge:</p>

<ol>
<li>At least one browser (Safari 4) does not flush cookies when the user turns them
off <span class="caps">AND</span> it just sends back any it has lying around for your domain with the request.</li>
<li>Thus, it&#8217;s not possible to tell if a browser is actually accepting Cookies until
you make a round trip with some sort of &#8216;detector&#8217; cookie &#8211; i.e. something with a
changing time stamp or a random value.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t tell if the previous &#8216;detector&#8217; cookie was actually set without comparing
it to the previous value which was sent.</li>
<li>The previous value has to be stored in the Session Store</li>
<li>Sessions must be active to look in the session store</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t be sure to activate the right session store without giving it a Session Id.</li>
<li>The only place to get a Session Id w/o cookies is from the Query String or $_COOKIE,
so you will probably end up using stale cookie or a hijacked one.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a Stale Cookie in $_COOKIE, you still have to set up sessions.
<span class="caps">PHP</span> will do that but it either has to send the session id as in cookie
or put it in the <span class="caps">URL</span>. If it uses a cookie, we won&#8217;t get it back unless cookies are
turned on in the client (a classic &#8216;catch 22&#8217;), so it will have to go into the <span class="caps">URL</span>.</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve started the session, you can&#8217;t turn off cookies in the <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8211; which is
what you want to avoid in the first place!</li>
<li>So, if you go that route &#8211; end up with a session id in the <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8211; you have to
destroy the session, expire that cookie, and start over. You can then set the new
session cookie and redirect again &#8211; now knowing that that cookies work.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s too complicated, so there&#8217;s no way <em>reasonable</em> to avoid publishing the session
id for in the <span class="caps">URL</span> without <em>never</em> putting it in there in the first place.</p>

<p>This has all been verified (at least to my satisfaction) by painful experimentation
using <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5.3.3.</p>

<p>(BTW: <span class="caps">PHP</span> is nice enough to issue a warning after when we changed the php.ini parameters after
the session was up and running. It lets you change them and <em>ini_get()</em> returned the
new values, but the changes don&#8217;t affect how the session works. Moral: Monitor the Apache Error Log!)</p>

<h2>So What&#8217;s the Plan</h2>

<p>Facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>we need to observe a detector cookie round trip</li>
<li>we must never put the session id in the Query String</li>
<li>we need a way to detect see if a <em>setcookie()</em> worked.</li>
<li>we are woking under Web rules &#8211; which means each request is completely
self contained with no history natural history. We have to add the bread
crumbs, as it were.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Case One</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll start with 3. If we don&#8217;t see any cookies or a cookie (think we) we
have previously set, then we&#8217;ll redirect to ourselves while:</p>

<ol>
<li>setting an identifiable token in the query string</li>
<li>setting three cookies: a user cookie, a session cookie, and a detector cookie</li>
<li>saving the value of the detector cookie in the session store.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, when we get a request w/o cookies, but with the identifiable token in the query
string, we know cookies aren&#8217;t working OR this is a hijack attempt.
If the token is valid, then we tell the Client to turn on cookies or we won&#8217;t play.
If not, we&#8217;ll assume that it&#8217;s a hijack and pretend we&#8217;re down or call the cops or something.</p>

<h3>Case Two</h3>

<p>Now let&#8217;s say we get a request and there are cookies. If we are missing the cookies
(think we) we have previously set, then we&#8217;re back to Case One &#8211; just as though there weren&#8217;t
any cookies. So we can go to Case One &#8211; at the place where we check the query string (look
at the diagram below, it&#8217;ll make more sense).</p>

<h3>Case Three</h3>

<p>Now let&#8217;s say we get a request, there are cookies and the session cookie and detector
cookie are set. Then we can start the session and see if the detector cookie matches
the one we got from the client.</p>

<p>If it matches, it&#8217;s a pretty good bet we know who we&#8217;re talking to and can proceed with
the rendering the page. If not, then we really don&#8217;t know if the client is accepting
and setting cookies, so it&#8217;s off to Case One again.</p>
