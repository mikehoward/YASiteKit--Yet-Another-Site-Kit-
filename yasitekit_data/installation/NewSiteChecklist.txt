h1. New Site Checklist

h2. Preparation for Developing Sites

# Setup Apache and PHP
# Create a directory for site development. I usually have several sites
in development, so I create a directory to put all the sites under. Each site
will have it's own subdirectory. I'm going to call this directory 'websites'.
## Create a virtual host entry for 'websites' and map it into the Apache document
## add an entry in /etc/hosts so that Apache can associate a site name with your
'websites' directory. "see video":http://youtube.com?something
directory.

For those who don't know, here's how all this works:

# apache needs a host name - so you have to put one in your /etc/hosts directory.
[there are other ways to do this, but they are much more complex]
# when you point your browser to http://websites, your browser looks up the address
of the host 'websites' using very complex schemes. But the first place it looks is
/etc/hosts, so by putting it there, the browser knows to talk to your local apache
server.
# your local apache server gets the request and looks at the host name in the URL
[it's the part after the http:// part and before the first slash (/)]. It then
looks to see if it has a virtual host configured for that name. If it does, it
then looks for the Document Root directory for that virtual host.
# You've set up a symbolic 

h2. Setting up a Single Site

# Create directory for your site development in 'websites'. We'll call it 'site',
so the path to that directory is 'webites/site'. [It's probably in your home
directory on your Mac or Linux machine, so the real path name will be '~/websites/site,
where '~' expands to the absolute path to your home]
# download and unpack http://www.yasitekit.org/downloads/site-framework-with-system.tar.gz
into your development directory. 
## download http://www.yasitekit.org/downloads/site-framework-with-system.tar.gz. This will
probably put it someplace conventional: like your desktop or Downloads or something like that.
## cd ~/websites/site
## mv ~/Downloads/site-framework-with-system.tar.gz .
## tar xzf site-framework-with-system.tar.gz
# Fix permissions
## cd ~/websites/site/private_root/installation
## /bin/sh fix_perms.sh - follow on screen instructions
# Run configurator
## point your browser to http://websites/site/private_root/installation/configurator.php
