<h1>aparser.php &#8211; A Parser for little languages</h1>

<p>This is top-down, recursive parser in <span class="caps">PHP</span></p>

<p>Parser is a <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5 object which takes a <strong>right, recursive language specification</strong>
in more-or-less yacc/bison format and magically becomes a top-down, recursive
descent, predictive parser. If the grammer is written properly, it even works.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> yacc/bison and most other parser generators are use a <em>shift-reduce</em>
algorithmn and so they require <strong>left recursive</strong> grammars to keep the parser
from going into an infinite loop. Recursive descent &#8211; on the other hand &#8211; needs the grammar to be <strong>right recursive</strong>. [Go read the Dragon book if you
want more detail &#8211; or even to correct any garbage I may be slinging]</p>

<p>This module defines several helper classes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#parser">Parser</a> &#8211; the actual Parser Class &#8211; follow this link for
the details of the object.</li>
<li><a href="#parsernode">ParserNode</a> &#8211; nodes which are created by the parser when
parsing a sentense in the target language</li>
<li><a href="#parserlangnode">ParserLangNode</a> &#8211; nodes used by the Parser and ParsesrLangDefParser
in parsing the target language definition. These are used by the Parser in
running the parse (phew)</li>
<li><a href="#parserlangdefparser">ParserLangDefParser</a> &#8211; the object which parses the
target language definition and prepares the table which drives the parser. It
produces an array of ParserLangNodes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grammar Specification Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> may be inserted anywhere in a grammer by enclosing them in
C-style comment markers: &#8217;/&#42; ..... &#42;/&#8217;. Everything following, and including,
the first &#8217;/&#42;&#8217; is discarded up <em>through</em> the first &#8217;&#42;/&#8217;. <strong>Comments</strong> do <em>not</em>
next.</p>

<p><strong>Terminals</strong> start with a capital letter OR are single quote enclosed punctuation marks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>T, <span class="caps">TERMINAL</span>, Terminal, &#8217;:&#8217;, &#8217;,&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>non-terminals</strong> start with a lower case letters and contain lower case letters, digits
and underscore characters (_).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>foo, bar, foo_bar10</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Directives</strong> start with a percent prefixed keyword. There are only a limited number.</p>

<ul>
<li>%start &lt;non-terminal&gt; &#8211; optional &#8211; defines the start non-terminal</li>
<li>%action_prefix{ <em>php code</em> %} &#8211; optional &#8211; defines code which prefixes
<em>every</em> action. This is where you put global variables and other stuff.
<span class="caps">NOTE</span>: &#8217;%action_prefix{&#8217; is all one word &#8211; no interior blanks.</li>
<li>%action_suffix{ <em>php code</em> %} &#8211; optional &#8211; code which is appended
to <em>every</em> action.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>non-terminal definitions:</strong>
all non-terminals are uniquely defined by a set of production definitions.
non-terminal definitions start with the non-terminal, followed by a colon (:),
followed by one or more productions (separated by pipe symbols (|)), and terminated
by a semicolon (;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The syntax is: non-terminal &#8217;:&#8217; production | production | production | ... ;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>productions</strong> are sequences of symbols, semantic_name declarations, and semantic actions.
For example &#8216;A B ( C ) {some action}&#8217;.</p>

<p>A production may be empty. An empty production
should always be the last production in a non-terminal definition. It is symbolized
by only putting white space between the production separator (|) and the definition
terminator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>foo: A foo | ;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>semantic_names</strong> are identifiers enclosed in parenthesis. <em>identifiers</em> satisfy
the regular expression [a-zA-Z]\w*.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examples: (A), (foo), (foo_bar_1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two types of <strong>semantic actions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>%string{ ... } &#8211; which contains a list of language symbol references which
are concatenated together and then assigned to the non-terminal being defined</li>
<li>%php{ ... } &#8211; which contains <span class="caps">PHP</span> code which is executed. The code may contain
language symbol references which will be substituted <em>verbatum</em> with the values
of the indicated symbols. This may lead to <span class="caps">PHP</span> syntax errors if strings are
not properly quoted and/or interior characters are not properly escaped.</li>
</ul>

<p>The contents of a <em>%string</em> form may only consist of symbol references and
white space. Each symbol reference must be surrounded by white space &#8211; unless
it is the first or last symbol reference where the white space between the
reference and the bracket is optional: as in &#8217;%string{ A }&#8217; or &#8217;%string{A}&#8217;.
[for the lazy, <em>%string{</em> can be abbreviated <em>%str{</em> ]</p>

<p>In the <span class="caps">PHP</span> form, verything inside the braces is opaque to the parser, so
you can actually put about anything in there you want. The only caviate
is that any embedded braces must match. That is &#8217;%php{ ... {...}...} is OK,
but %php{ { } and %php{ } } are not. However &#8211; if you need to embed an
unmatched (read unmatchable) brace, you can by escaping it with a backslash (/).
That is: &#8217;%php{ ... \} ... }&#8217; is ok and will be translated to &#8217;%php{ ... } ... }&#8217;.
Similarly, &#8217;%php{ ... \{ ... }&#8217; translates to &#8217;%php{ ... { ... }&#8217;.</p>

<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> semantic actions are executed when the parser&#8217;s <em>execute()</em> method is run.
This contrasts with other parsers which ususally perform semantic actions
while parsing is in progress.</p>

<p><strong>special variable names</strong> in semantic actions refer to symbols which occur in the same production,
augmented by the non-terminal being defined. In other words, in &#8216;foo: A B {action1} | C D { action2 }&#8217;,
the code <em>action2</em> will may refer to the values of C and D, but not A or B. It may assign a
value to <em>foo</em>. Similarly, action1 may refer to values of A and B, but not C and D. Again,
it can assign a value to <em>foo</em></p>

<p><strong>special variables names</strong> can be <span class="caps">EITHER</span> <em>semantic_names</em>
or a speical form which mimics the convention used in yacc, bison, lemon, and many
other parser generators:</p>

<ul>
<li>@@ refers to the non-terminal being defined. This is a read-write variable.</li>
<li>@1, @2, ... refer to the preceeding symbols and semantic actions in the rule,
as defined above. These are <em>read-only</em> variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <strong>semantic action</strong> returns a value, it is assigned to the action and may be used
by other actions to the right and in the same production. Othewise it is assigned
the value <span class="caps">NULL</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">PHP</span> Semantic Actions Expanded</h3>

<p>Semantics are grafted on to the parse tree using <em>semantic actions</em>.</p>

<h4>String Semantic Actions</h4>

<p>String actions are enclosed in &#8217;%string{&#8217; &#8217;}&#8217; symbols. [alternately, &#8217;%str{ ... } ]
The contents consists
solely of white space separated language symbol references (see the next subsection).
The values of all references are concatenated together and assigned to the
non-terminal being defined. That is: &#8216;foo : A B %string{ @1 @2 }&#8217; concatenates
the values of the terminals &#8216;A&#8217; and &#8216;B&#8217; and assigns the result to &#8216;foo&#8217;.
Note that this <em>overwrites</em> any value &#8216;foo&#8217; had in this node. This is generally
not a problem, because when you want to append values, you usually recurse, as in</p>

<pre>foo : A B foo %string{ @1 @2 @3 }.
</pre>

<pre>foo : A B %string{ @1 @2 } %string{ @1 @2 @3 }
</pre>

<p>which doubles the concatenation of A and B and assigns it to foo [the
first assignment is overwritten]. [of course, this is contrived
because it would be easier to write the action as %str{ @1 @2 @1 @2 },
but you get the idea]</p>

<h4><span class="caps">PHP</span> Actions</h4>

<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> actions are <span class="caps">PHP</span> enclosed in curly braces: &#8217;%php{&#8217; &#8217;}&#8217; and are executed
as <span class="caps">PHP</span> Functions in the context described below.</p>

<p>All production symbols &#8211; including the non-terminal being defined &#8211; are
available for use in the function. The non-terminal being defined can
be assigned a value by writing &#8217;@@ = some experssion&#8217;. <a href="#php_action_symbols">See</a>
for details</p>

<p>This allows more complex formatting than <em>string actions</em> do as well
as communication and modification with the enclosing environment &#8211; see Execution Context, below, for more detail.</p>

<p>Each <span class="caps">PHP</span> action may have a prefix and suffix which can set up a more
elaborate execution context. See <a href="#php_action_prefix_suffix">Execution Prefix and Suffix</a></p>

<p>All values of production symbols are initialized to local function
variables &#8211; as described <a href="#php_action_symbols">below</a>. The value of each symbol depends
its nature:</p>

<ul>
<li>terminals &#8211; defined by the semantic_value returned by the scanner.
This value is immutable.</li>
<li>non-terminals &#8211; initially defined as the empty string. May be modified by
semantic actions &#8211; as described below.</li>
<li>string actions &#8211; the concatenation of the symbols named in the string action,
in the order of their occurance.</li>
<li>php actions &#8211; the return value of the code upon execution by calling
the <em>render()</em> method on the semantic action&#8217;s ParseNode instance.</li>
<li>error messages &#8211; the value returned by the error handler. This is immutable.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="php_action_symbols">Accessing Symbol Values</h5>

<p>Each symbol (and semantic action) in a non-terminal definition production
is assigned a symbolic name.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>a : foo { if (@1) { @@ = @1; } }
</pre>

<p>which tests to see if the value of <em>foo</em> is not false in some sense and, if it isn&#8217;t,
assigns the value of <em>foo</em> (@1) to the <em>a</em> (@@).</p>

<p>Each symbol in a production is automatically assigned a name. The non-terminal
being defined is named &#8217;@@&#8217;. The symbols in the production are named &#8217;@1&#8217;, &#8217;@2&#8217;, ...
in order of appearence in the production. <em>This includes semantic actions</em>.</p>

<p>For example, in:</p>

<pre>a : foo { if (@1) { @@ .= @1; return TRUE; } else { return FALSE; } } bar { @@ .= @3; }
</pre>

<p>the assignments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>@@ &#8211; a</li>
<li>@1 &#8211; foo</li>
<li>@2 &#8211; the value returned by &#8217;{ @@ .= @1; return <span class="caps">TRUE</span>; } else { return <span class="caps">FALSE</span>; ; }&#8217;.
[FALSE will automatically be returned if no explicit return is included]</li>
<li>@3 &#8211; bar</li>
<li>@4 &#8211; the value returned by &#8217;{ @@ .= @3; }&#8217; &#8211; which is <span class="caps">FALSE</span> in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can get difficult to maintain, so each <em>symbol</em> may be given an explicit
name by following it with a word in parenthesis, as in <em>foo (F)</em>. Traditionally,
this word will be a single, upper case letter &#8211; but it can be any word
which satisfies <em>\w+</em>. [I don&#8217;t know where the tradition came from or even if
it&#8217;s really a tradition. I stole this from the Lemon parser documentation
because I like the idea.]</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

<pre>a : foo { @@ = @1; }
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>a (A) : foo (FOO) { A = FOO; }
</pre>

<p>are equivalent, execute identical code, and achieve the same result.</p>

<p>You can mix and match.</p>

<h5 id="php_action_context">Execution Context</h5>

<p>In contrast with other parser generators, the parser does not execute
semantic actions during the parse. First the parse tree is constructed
by the <em>parse()</em> method. The semantic actions are <em>only</em> executed
when the <em>render()</em> method is invoked. <em>render()</em> returns the
value assigned to the <em>start</em> non-terminal.</p>

<p>Each <em>semantic action</em> executes in the context of a temporary function.
Each symbol reference is transformed into a local variable and the
current value of each symbol is passed in the argument list to the
body of the function. The local variable names are generated
automatically:</p>

<ul>
<li>$__context &#8211; the context object passed in from outside. This is passed
by value and is usually an object reference, so that object methods and
attributes are available within the local function context.</li>
<li>$__non_terminal &#8211; for the non-terminal being defined &#8211; symbol reference @@</li>
<li>$__var1 &#8211; for the first symbol in the production &#8211; @1</li>
<li>$__var2 &#8211; for the second symbol in the production &#8211; i.e. @2</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>The calling sequence passess <em>$__non_terminal</em> as a reference and the others
as values.</p>

<p>Note: this means that you can write &#8216;normal <span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8217; expressions using the symbol
references &#8211; such as</p>

<pre>'@@ = @1 . @2;' or '"it rains in {@1}\n".
</pre>

<h5 id="php_action_prefix_suffix">Execution Prefix and Suffix</h5>

<p>Each (and every) semantic action may be prefixed and suffixed by chunks of code
which are defined in the <em>language definition</em> using the <em>%action_prefix</em> and
<em>%action_suffix</em> directives.</p>

<p>This is a limited feature because:</p>

<ul>
<li>only one prefix and one suffix may be defined</li>
<li>the prefix and suffix code are prepended and appended to the action body
for each and every action prior to execution</li>
<li>the prefix and suffix are defined in the <em>language specification</em> and so
are a fixed part of the language. In other words, you can&#8217;t use a different
prefix or suffix when parsing different string.</li>
<li>if the body of the action executes a <em>return</em>, then the suffix code
is not executed. This can be a feature if, for example, you want to assign
a default value to every <em>semantic action</em> and only return significant
ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you use this stuff for?</p>

<p>Well you can put global variables in the prefix and they will then be accessible
from every action.</p>

<p>You can create a default return value [see above].</p>

<p>You can probably think of lots of other things.</p>

<h2 id="parser">Parser &#8211; the parser object</h2>

<p>Each parser is an instance of a Parser object. It needs a language definition
(see above) and a scanner (see <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/ascanner.html">ascanner.php</a>).</p>

<p>Once the scanner and language grammar are constructed, the parser object is
very easy to use.</p>

(found in <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/ascanner.html">ascanner.php</a>).</li>
<li>context &#8211; typically an object. This is used to pass an object reference to
<span class="caps">PHP</span> actions so that they can access methods and attributes defined in the object.

<h3>Class Methods</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Instance Methods</h3>

<p>Usual magic methods, dump(), and . . .</p>

<p>Recursive descent parsers &#8211; like all parsers &#8211; are very sensitive to the order in which
productions are tested. For example, for the language &#8216;foo: A | A foo;&#8217;, when
presented with the string &#8216;AAAA&#8217;, the parser will announce completion after seeing
the first &#8216;A&#8217; and will ignore the trailing &#8216;AAA&#8217;. If the grammar is rewritten
as &#8216;foo: A foo | A;&#8217;, then the parser will recognize &#8216;AAAA&#8217; and finish processing
the string. This is a good thing.</p>

<p>So we provide (crude) sorting support for fixing sloppily written (or edited) grammars.
Calling <em>sort()</em> is optional, so one strategy for testing to see if your grammar
is really what you want is:</p>

<ol>
<li>feed your grammar to ParserLangDefParser &#8211; by creating an instance.</li>
<li>print the instance as a string &#8211; this will print out your grammar in a nicely
indented display.</li>
<li>invoke the <em>sort()</em> method on your instance.</li>
<li>print out the instance as a string (again) and compare it with the first printout.</li>
<li>then do something which you think is a good idea.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>sort(cmp_func = ParserLangDefParser::cmp_productions) &#8211; sorts the language productions
using the comparision function. The default comparison function sorts the products
so that:
<ul>
<li>the productions with the most non-terminals are tested first. The order is in reverse
of the number of non-terminals in a production. For example foo: a b c | T b c | T S c | T</li>
<li>within productions with the same number of non-terminals, they are sorted so that
the longest are tested first.</li>
<li>if any empty productions exist, they are deleted and a single empty production is
tested last.</li>
</ul>

<li>cmp_productions(p1, p2) &#8211; used to sort the production array. returns -1, 0, or 1
