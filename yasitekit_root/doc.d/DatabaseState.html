<h1 style="margin-left:.5em;">Database-States &#8211; <span class="caps">OBSOLETE</span>: Database States and State Transitions &#8211; how we change the DB w/o blowing it away</h1>

<p style="clear:both;" class="advisory"><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: This is an Old Design and has been superceeded. It didn&#8217;t work
well enough.</p>

<p style="clear:both;text-decoration:line-through;" class="advisory"><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: This is a Work In Progress. This Document is
a Draft Document.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">Database activity, allowable access, etc is continuously monitored and summarized
in the &#8220;Database State&#8221;.</p>

<p>This allows a developer to safely modify Persistent data definitions without unintentionally
losing data. Modifications which are managed:</p>

<ul>
<li>renaming fields</li>
<li>deleting fields</li>
<li>changing field definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding new persistent objects is more or less automatic &#8211; in that the tables magically appear
and &#8211; if the code works &#8211; so do the management objects.</p>

<p><strong>Deleting persistent data objects automatically is <em>not</em> supported.</strong> To delete an object, remove
it from the <span class="caps">PHP</span> include paths and delete the table. If the object participates in AJoin
style joins, then it is probably good to at least empty its join tables. Finally, if
you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll never want to reconstitute its, then you can remove the row in
the <strong>_encrpytors</strong> table for that object. This must be all done by hand and &#8211; so &#8211; it&#8217;s
prone to error.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">WARNING</span>:</strong> deleting objects from the <em>system / objects</em> directory can be futile, but is also
possible. If you ever upgrade the site, those objects and their management interfaces will
probably come back. [upgrading a site involves copying a new <em>system</em> hierarchy over the
existing one.] In order to do it, you must manually remove the objects and their management
interfaces (from <em>system / pages</em>) and (possibly) edit them out of the <em>system / page_structure</em>
menus.</p>

<p>If you do this, take good notes so you can do it after upgrading.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easier just to not use the deleted object.</p>

<p>There are probably some other hacks you can do. Go ahead. It&#8217;s your site. If you find something
clever and at least semi-automated, send it to me for possible inclusion.</p>

<p>Topics covered here are:</p>

<li><a href="#database_state">Database State</a> &#8211; what the state is, what it means, where and how
it is maintained.</li>
<li><a href="#legal_states">Legal &amp; Illegal States</a> &#8211; Legal and Illegal combinations of State Variables</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="clear:both;" id="site_state">Site State</h2>

<p><a href="img/StateTransitions.jpg?target=:blank"><img src="img/StateTransitions.jpg" style="width:30%;clear:both;float:right;" title="Site State Transition Diagram" alt="Site State Transition Diagram" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>The Site state is pretty simple. It tracks the value of the database <em>on_line</em> state variable.
The site states are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>online</strong> &#8211; the site is useable as it is expected to be</li>
<li><strong>read-only</strong> &#8211; the site can be accessed, but cannot be modified &#8211; except data updates to
specified metadata tables [initially &#8216;_dbaccess&#8217; and &#8216;sessions&#8217;]</li>
<li><strong>offline</strong> &#8211; the site is down for some sort of maintenance. This can be a full database
reload or simply a software upgrade.</li>
<li><strong id="illegal_edit">illegal edit detected</strong> &#8211; the site is unusable and cannot be rebuilt until the edit is
corrected. This is not so much a state as a condition. When an illegal edit is
detected, the database can&#8217;t be rebuilt nor the site brought back on line until it is
corrected. An illegal edit is something which breaks persistent data object access. At
present, all illegal edits involve mucking with persistent object key fields: deleting
keys, renaming keys, changing their data types, or adding keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each state change is accompanied by a change in one or more Database State Variables.</p>

<p>Each arrow connecting a state change is labelled by an indication of the event or
action which occurred. The rest of this section expands each of those details.</p>

<h3>model mismatch</h3>

<p>This happens when a developer removes, renames, or adds a field to a persistent object.
See <a href="#model_mismatch">below</a> for details</p>

<h3>take offline</h3>

<p>This is an action initiated by someone with Administrator privilege. It manually takes
the database and site off line.</p>

<h3>archive database</h3>

<p>This is an action initiated by someone with Administrator privilege. Normally this is
done using the ReloadDB.php administrative page. It may also be commanded by running
the dbaccess_attributes.php script in the <em>installation</em> directory.</p>

<p>The archiving script will always save static infrastructure and data, but will only
save down the model structure and table definitions <em>only</em> if <em>model_mismatch</em> is &#8216;F&#8217;.
This preserves the state of the database models across manual edits and is necessary
to create a database map function and to detect illegal edits.</p>

<h3>need map</h3>

<p>This action results automatically when running the administrative page ReloadDB.php.
The script automatically checks to see if a map function will be required and presents
a form which allows the operator to create one.</p>

<h3>create map</h3>

<p>This action occurs as a result of selecting the Create Map option in the ReloadDB.php
administrative page. It creates a map function as <span class="caps">PHP</span> code which is stored in the
archive <em>dump</em> directory.</p>

<h3>Manual Edit</h3>

<p>This is not a programmatically supported action.</p>

<p>It occurs when a developer mucks up and has to go in and fix it.</p>

<p>After editing, the developer must start up the <strong>Reload Database</strong> script via
the &#8216;Administrative Tools&#8217; menu. The script will then re-check the model
against the database and reset the <em>model_mismatch</em>  state variable.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">IMPORTANT</span>:</strong> fix your code. Don&#8217;t try to muck with the archive.</p>

<h3>rebuild infrastructure</h3>

<p>This action occurs as a result of an administrator choosing the &#8216;Rebuild Infrastructure&#8217;
option in the ReloadDB.php page. This action creates critical, non-persistent object tables
(the exception being the table for the Account object, which is required for admin access).
Most of these are tables have names beginning with an underscore character(_). The exceptions
are the <em>sessions</em> and <em>account</em> tables. See
<a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aclass.html">aclass.php</a> for details of the Encryptors and AJoin
support tables; see <a href="/doc.d/system-objects/Parameters.html">Parameters.php</a> for details
of the _parameters table; see <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/dbaccess.html">DBAccess</a> for
details about the _dbaccess table.</p>

<h3>reload database</h3>

<p>This action occurs when the administrator chooses the &#8216;Reload Database&#8217; option from
the ReloadDB.php page. It reloads all of the persistent data object data into
the database from the current database archive files. If a map function exists, then
it is applied &#8211; on an object by object basis &#8211; to implement field renamings.</p>

<h3>db rebuild complete</h3>

<p>This action occurs automatically as a result of successfully completing the reload database
operation &#8211; above.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;" id="database_state">Database State</h2>

<p>Database state is maintained in a table named <strong>_dbaccess</strong>, consisting of the following
single character flags:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#on_line">on_line</a> &#8211; F, T, R &#8211; This controls &#8211; to a very large extent &#8211; what database actions may
be performed.</li>
<li><a href="#database_valid">database_valid</a> &#8211; T or F &#8211; A transitional state used in database rebuilds. If T, then
it means the database is in a consistent state</li>
<li><a href="#archive_stale">archive_stale</a> &#8211; T or F &#8211; indicates the current database archive is out of date</li>
<li><a href="#model_mismatch">model_mismatch</a> &#8211; T, F or X &#8211; set to T if, when any object is loaded, an attribute is detected in the database which is not in the current data model. It is set
to X if the map building logic in ReloadDB.php detects an <a href="#illegal_edit">illegal edit</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Database State Variables in Detail</h3>

<p>This section defines (in boring detail) the possible values and their meanings for each
state variable <span class="caps">AND</span> the transition rules &#8211; i.e. the events which cause the transitions
to occur and the pre-requisites for making the transitions.</p>

<p>All state transitions are intended to be made serially &#8211; that is, one at a time.
This is to simplify understanding the logic. The intent is that all legal state
changes are completely defined by these rules.</p>

<p>State transitions are specified in the tables below. Each row is color coded:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>transition color codes</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:lightgreen;">
<td>legal transition w/o prerequisites</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:#f08000;">
<td>legal transition if prerequisites are met</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:red;">
<td>illegal transition</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The <strong>Prerequisites</strong> column specifies specific conditions on other state variables
for a transition. Multiple conditions are separated by semi-colons (;); the semi-colon
is interpreted as <span class="caps">AND</span>. These conditions are of the form:</p>

<ul>
<li>state_variable : value &#8211; e.g. database_valid:T &#8211; Must BE &#8216;T&#8217;</li>
<li>state_variable : ~value &#8211; e.g. model_mismatch:~F &#8211; anything <span class="caps">EXCEPT</span> &#8216;F&#8217;</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: that some <strong>prequisites</strong> are implied by a transitive relationship between
states. For example, <em>database_valid:T</em> requires <em>model_mismatch:F</em>, so that
requirement is implicit in the <strong>prerequisite</strong> for transitioning <em>on_line</em> from
&#8216;F&#8217; to &#8216;T&#8217;.</p>

<p>Various combinations of states are Illegal. If the database is found in one of these
Illegal states, then the database must be marked offline and invalid by setting
<em>on_line</em> to &#8216;F&#8217; and <em>database_valid</em> to &#8216;F&#8217;. This should also generate an e-mail
to the site administrator warning of this condition.</p>

<h4 id="on_line">on_line</h4>

<p>Meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>F &#8211; not on line. Anything (no matter how horrible) may be done to the database and it&#8217;s data.</li>
<li>T &#8211; Database is online. Table definitions may not be modified or dropped. Data may be read or written</li>
<li>R &#8211; Database is Read Only. Table definitions may not be modified, dropped, but may be created.
Data may not be modified &#8211; except for specified metadata tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transition Rules:</p>

<h4 id="database_valid">database_valid</h4>

<p>Values and Meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>T &#8211; database may be archived, read, written.</li>
<li>F &#8211; database is being reconstructed, so not all tables may be valid. Not database is not useable.</li>

</table>

<h4 id="archive_stale">archive_stale</h4>

<p>Values and Meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>T &#8211; Set on first data modification committed to database after an archive operation
has completed. Indicates that the current archive is out of date.</li>
<li>F &#8211; Set after an archive operation has completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transition Rules:</p>

<td>F</td>
<td>on_line:F</td>
<td>successful database archive</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4 id="model_mismatch">model_mismatch</h4>

<p>While the database (and site) is on-line (<em>on_line</em> == T),
consistency between the database table and the AClass object definitions is continuously
monitored. Two tests are performed: one for changes to field names or data types
and the other for illegal edits. Both use an MD5 hash of field names and data types.</p>

<p>If a change in field name or data type is detected, then the key field hash is checked
to see if there has been an illegal edit. If there has not, then the <em>model_mismatch</em>
flag is set to &#8216;T&#8217; and the site goes into read only mode by setting <em>on_line</em> to &#8216;R&#8217;.
If an illegal edit has been detected, then the <em>model_mismatch</em> flag is set to &#8216;X&#8217;
and the <em>on_line</em> flag is set to &#8216;F&#8217; &#8211; taking the site offline.</p>

<p>In Read-Only mode, the site continues to run, but it may not be updated. Fields which are
defined in the database, but not in the objects, are ignored. Fields in objects which are
not in the database are initialized to &#8216;null&#8217; values (empty strings, 0 integers, etc),
but &#8211; inasmuch as the database is in read-only mode &#8211; these &#8216;null&#8217; values are never stored.</p>

<p>When the site is in Off-Line mode, it can only be accessed by an administrator and
the database must be rebuilt interactively to bring the model and data into
proper synchronization.</p>

<p>Values and Meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>T &#8211; At least one Persistent object field is in the database and not in the object
definition or vice versa.</li>
<li>X &#8211; An Illegal Edit was detected</li>
<li>F &#8211; No inconsistencies have been detected.</li>
</ul>
