<h1>Development-Control &#8211; Controlling Site Development</h1>

<p style="clear:both;" class="advisory"><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: This is a Work In Progress. This Document is
a Draft Document.</p>

<p style="clear:both;padding-top:1em;">Site development almost always follows the same pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>copy the demo site</li>
<li>change the name of the site to a new name and change the root and private data
directory names</li>
<li>edit the config.php file(s)</li>
<li>hack the local apache configuration files to point to the development site so it
can be served. Usually as a Virtual Host</li>
<li>add the site name to /etc/hosts or equivalent</li>
<li>bring up the site in a browser to see what you&#8217;ve got. Then swear a little, fix
errors and repeat until it comes up</li>
<li>sign on as Admin and write the basic articles &#8211; About, Home, Terms, Privacy,
and help articles.</li>
<li>create your first Archive</li>
<li>take a nap</li>
</ol>

<p>After the nap, you start hacking. If you don&#8217;t need any new AnInstance objects &#8211; like a specialized Product or fancy new Newsletter, you just hack away at the
<span class="caps">CSS</span>, Menu definitions and maybe a few more pages. Put them in the private data
subdirectories named for those purposes. <strong>don&#8217;t touch anything below <em>system</em></strong></p>

<p>You do this and save down your data by creating new archives every once in a while.</p>

<p>Life is simple.</p>

<p><span class="caps">BUT</span> if you need to add a persistent object or create a custom version of one,
then you need to understand <strong>Site Versioning</strong> and <strong>Maps</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the rules for creating new AnInstance Objects.</p>

<ol>
<li>The objects go in <em>private-data / objects</em>. This is first on the
include path, so your definitions override the system. There are
no name collisions.</li>
<li>The Management Page goes in <em>private-data / pages</em></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t delete anything from <em>system / objects</em> or <em>system / pages</em></li>
<li>steal as much codes as possible</li>
<li>you can usually make do what you want by defining new fields and/or
changing the data type of existing fields.</li>
<li>it&#8217;s <span class="caps">ILLEGAL</span> to change the definition of any of the key fields of an
existing object. You can do what you want copying the existing object
and giving it a new name.</li>
<li>read the <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/aclass.html">aclass.php</a> documentation if you
have questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve changed something in the model structure (by creating a modified
version of a previously existing object), you have to instruct the
Archive and Restore system how to do it&#8217;s job. This is called &#8216;creating
a map&#8217; and &#8216;System Conversion&#8217;.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we have to get complicated and introduce Site Versioning.</p>

<p>Site Versioning refers to the general process of managing changes to the
data structure of a site. It does not refer to the evolution of data in
the site, but it does facilitate converting data between versions of the
site.</p>

<p>It gets a bit complex in the general case, so we use a deliberately simplified
method and rely on judgement to avoid creating unworkable messes.</p>

<h2>Concurrent Development Issues</h2>

<p>This model doesn&#8217;t work well with two or more developers working simultaneously.</p>

<p>How to patch it up?</p>

<h3 id="master_slave_concurrent_dev">Master site integration Method</h3>

<p>We have a master site which has it&#8217;s own version number &#8211; again, a simple,
monotonically increasing integer.</p>

<p>We have one site for each developer. The developer &#8216;checks out&#8217; a copy of
the master site, complete with master site version number (&#8216;master site version N&#8217;)
and starts hacking. The checked out site is now &#8216;developer version 1&#8217;.</p>

<p>Developer does something which causes a version increment. This becomes
&#8216;developer version 2&#8217;, but stays at &#8216;master site version N&#8217;.</p>

<p>Continues, eventually developer is happy and decides to check in his work to
the master site, so he/she/it sends it to the master Master, who is in charge
of checking in changes.</p>

<p>At this point, Master sees that the main site is at &#8216;master site version M&#8217; &#8211; an increase of (M-N) versions beyond the developer&#8217;s version. Master has a
big snit fit and throws the code in the waste basket.</p>

<p>Plan B: Before sending his developed site to master Master, developer creates
an archive of his local site. He pulls down a copy of the code from the master
site and does a merge. Several days later, he staggers to his feet and repeats
this process. When the code is stable, he quickly (so as not to lose his window
of opportunity) does a <a href="#site_restore_convert"><strong>Site Conversion</strong></a> using his
local archive as the <a href="#map"><strong>Source</strong></a> and the merged code as <a href="#map"><strong>Target</strong></a>.
He archives this and ships an <strong>Update Package</strong>:#update_package_ to master Master.</p>

<p>master Master then checks the version numbers of the submitted patch.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the submitted <strong>Update Package</strong> is at a lower &#8216;master version number&#8217; than
the current &#8216;master version number&#8217;, the master Master rejects the update
and tells the developer to start over.</li>
<li>if the submitted &#8216;master version number&#8217; is greater than the current &#8216;master
version number&#8217;, master Master shoots the developer or laughs at the joke &#8211; 50&#8211;50
odds, determined by flipping &#8216;the unbiased coin&#8217;</li>
<li>if the &#8216;master version number&#8217; matches the current &#8216;master version number&#8217;
and the developer version number is &#8216;1&#8217;, then master Master concludes that
no AnInstance objects have been harmed, and so simply updates the master code
and increments the &#8216;master code version number&#8217; (WHAT!!!! &#8211; where did this come from????)</li>
<li>finally, if &#8216;master version number&#8217;s match and &#8216;developer version number&#8217; >= 2,
then master Master performs a <strong>Site Conversion</strong>:#site_restore_convert and
prays that nothing malicious has happened.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="update_package">Update Package for Concurrent Development</h4>

<p><span class="caps">TBD</span></p>

<p>It will contain &#8211; at the least:</p>

<ul>
<li>version numbers: master version number and developer version number.</li>
<li>attribute definitions and properties for all defined AnInstance objects</li>
<li>A Code patch which will update between the master version and the submitted
revision.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="distributed_concurrent_dev">Distributed Version Method</h3>

<p>This is too hard.</p>

<h2>Definitions and Functional Rquirements</h2>

<p>This section defines several technical terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#site_versioning">Site Versioning</a></li>
<li><a href="#version_archive">Version Archive</a></li>
<li><a href="#version_number">Version Number</a></li>
<li><a href="#site_version">Site Version</a></li>
<li><a href="#site_restore_convert">Site Restoration and Conversions</a></li>
<li>a <a href="#map">Map</a></li>
<li>a <a href="#map_template">Map Template</a></li>
<li><a href="#create_map">Map Creation</a></li>
<li><a href="#map_review">Map Review/Approval</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These Definitions constitute the Functional Requirements for Site Versioning and Site
Conversion.</p>

<h3 id="site_versioning">Site Versioning</h3>

<p><strong>Site Versioning</strong> refers to the data needed to completely characterize a site
at a specific point in time and with a specific data model.</p>

<h3 id="version_archive">Version Archive</h3>

<p>A <strong>Version Archive</strong> is a collection of site data, data model parameters, and
database table definitions. The collection is sufficiently complete so that
it is possible to:</p>

<ol>
<li>recreate the site at that version &#8211; assuming a compatible software base is available</li>
<li>given a different version of the site, determine if a map can be created to load
the data from this archive into the different version</li>
<li>create a map &#8211; if required &#8211; to coordinate the data load into the different site</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Version Archive</strong> physically consist of a collection of files in a directory.
The name of the directory is constructed from the site name and version number
of the archive. For example, if the site is named &#8216;foo&#8217; and the <strong>Version Number</strong>
is &#8216;12, then the <strong>Version Archive</strong> will be in a directory named &#8216;foo-12&#8217;.</p>

<h3 id="version_number">Version Number</h3>

<p>A <strong>Version Number</strong> is a monotonically increasing integer which specifies the
version of a <strong>Version Archive</strong>. Version numbers are incremented when a <strong>Version Archive</strong>
is created and an analysis of the most recently versioned archive indicates that
a map will be required to convert between them.</p>

<p>The first <strong>Version Number</strong> is 1.</p>

<p>The <strong>Version Number</strong> of the live system is either the highest existing version number
or the highest plus 1, in the case of a model mismatch between the highest versioned
archive and the live system.</p>

<h3 id="site_version">Site Version</h3>

<p>A <strong>Site Version</strong> consists of the <strong>Version Number</strong> and the information necessary to
create the models used in the site. This consists of the AnInstance object definitions
for every AnInstance object in the site. The definitions consist of two arrays:</p>

<ul>
<li>attribute_defs &#8211; which defines the attributes &#8211; name, data type, and display name</li>
<li>attribute_properties &#8211; which define all the ancillary information for each field,
including specifying which fields are key fields.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="site_restore_convert">Site Restoration and Conversion</h3>

<p>A <strong>Site Restoration</strong> is the process of creating a database from a specified
<strong>Version Archive</strong> for a site with the same <strong>Site Version</strong> as the archive.</p>

<p>A <strong>Site Conversion</strong> is the process of creating a database from a specified
<strong>Version Archive</strong> for a site with a <span class="caps">DIFFERENT</span> <strong>Site Version</strong> than the
archive is for.</p>

<h3 id="map">Map</h3>

<p><a href="img/MapConstructionWorkflow.jpg?target=:blank"><img src="img/MapConstructionWorkflow.jpg" style="width:30%;padding:.5em;float:right;" title="Map Construction Workflow" alt="Map Construction Workflow" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Map</strong> functions are <em>only</em> required for <strong>Site Conversions</strong>. The chosen <strong>Version Archive</strong>
which is the source of the data is called the <strong>Source</strong>. The <strong>Site Version</strong>
which the database is being created for is called the <strong>Target</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Map</strong> is a function which takes the values of an AnInstance object from the <strong>Source</strong>
and returns an associative array of data for an <em>insert_into_table()</em> function. The
purpose of the <em>map</em> is to convert data to the model used in the <strong>Target</strong>.
Most frequently it will be used to convert between the latest <strong>Version Archive</strong> and
the <strong>live site</strong> during development. It may also be used to upgrade an alpha, beta,
release candidate, or production site to a trial or release version.</p>

<p>The application of the <strong>Map</strong> function to data is called <em>mapping</em>.</p>

<p>AnInstance objects which occur in the <strong>Source</strong>, but not in the <strong>Target</strong> are noted
with a message, but no mapping will be done.</p>

<p>AnInstance objects which are not in the <strong>Source</strong>, but which are in the <strong>Target</strong>
are also noted with a message, no mapping will be done.</p>

<p>The <em>map</em> can perform three actions on its input:</p>

<ul>
<li>discard data fields</li>
<li>initialize new fields to some default value (usually <span class="caps">NULL</span>)</li>
<li>rename fields</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Map</strong> function is named <em>map</em> and has the signature <em>map(object_name, values)</em> where:</p>

<ul>
<li>object_name &#8211; is the class name of an AnInstance object</li>
<li>values &#8211; is an associative array of values from <em>object_name</em>&#8216;s data in the <strong>Version Archive</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="map_template">Map Template</h3>

<p>A <strong>Map Template</strong> is an <span class="caps">HTML</span> form which may be used to construct a <strong>Map</strong> function. It
is produced automatically by analyzing the differences in the AnInstance object definitions
between a live system (which is currently running and for which the <strong>Map</strong> is being created)
and a set of saved definitions.</p>

<p>Prior to displaying the map, the model definitions in both the <strong>Source</strong> and the <strong>Target</strong>
an analyzed for Illegal model changes. If any are detected, then the form is
not displayed. Instead, a list of the violations is displayed along with a message
explaining that the conversion is not possible without modifying the <strong>Target</strong>
model.</p>

<p>If no Illegal model changes are detected, then the form is created.</p>

<p>The <strong>Map Template</strong> contains input elements for each field of each object which
is missing from or new in the <strong>Target</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>missing field &#8211; a <em>select</em> element with options to delete the element or rename it
to one of the newly defined fields</li>
<li>new field &#8211; choices for the initial value. Choices will be either <span class="caps">NULL</span> or a specific
value which is defined using a <em>text</em> input element.</li>
</ul>

<p>The template also contains analysis messages for all fields which have changed data
type. These messages will be either advisory, warnings, or errors.</p>

<ul>
<li>advisory messages are notices that the type change is OK and that there will be
no data loss.</li>
<li>warning messages are notices that the type change will work, but that there may
be data loss &#8211; typically possible truncation of string data</li>
<li>error message are notices that the type change is incompatible and that no map
will be produced.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create_map">Creating a Map</h3>

<p>A <strong>Map</strong> is created by interactively making choices in the <strong>Map Template</strong> form and then
executing the form.</p>

<p>In executing the map, the mapping choices are analyzed to make sure that they can
be performed. Illegal choices which are trapped are:</p>

<ul>
<li>mapping two or more missing fields to the same new field</li>
<li>an illegal initializer for a new field</li>
</ul>

<p>If an Illegal choice is detected, the form is redisplayed with a message indicating
the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Maps</strong> are stored in a pair of files. Each is named _map-site_id-source_version-target_version.ext.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first five characters are the literals: &#8216;_map-&#8217;</li>
<li><em>site_id</em> is the site id defined in the site&#8217;s <em>config.php</em> file and which is also used
in the <strong>Version Archive</strong> directory name</li>
<li><em>source_version</em> is the <strong>Version Number</strong> of <strong>Source</strong></li>
<li><em>target_version</em> is the <strong>Version Number</strong> of <strong>Target</strong></li>
<li><em>ext</em> is either:
<ul>
<li>php &#8211; for the actual map</li>
<li>txt &#8211; for the map description</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="map_review">Reviewing a Map</h3>

<p>Maps are displayed as a simple, textual description of their actions. Each object
in the <strong>Source</strong> or <strong>Target</strong> for which there is a mapping action will have a section.
Each field which is mapped will have an entry describing the effect. Advisory
messages will have a light green background; Warning messages will have
an orange background.</p>

<p>The purpose of displaying a map is to review it and take one of two actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Approve the map &#8211; indicated by clicking the Approve button. This will set
some <span class="caps">YET</span>-TO-BE-DEFINED persistent datum to indicate approval. This communicates
to the <strong>Site Conversion</strong> software that it is allowed to proceed.
<span class="caps">FIXME</span>: resolve this.</li>
<li>Recreate the map &#8211; indicated by clicking the ReMap button.</li>
<li>Delete the map &#8211; indicated by clicking the Delete button.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a requested map does not exist, then the <strong>Map Template</strong> is displayed along with
an explanatory message.</p>
