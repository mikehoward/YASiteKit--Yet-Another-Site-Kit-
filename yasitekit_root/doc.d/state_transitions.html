<h2>Events which Cause Transitions</h2>

<h3>Manual Events</h3>

<ol>
<li>Normal Operation
<ol>
<li>SAVE_RECORD &#8211; occurs each time a persistent object&#8217;s <em>save()</em> method is executed
and the object data has been modified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Admin takes site Offline or Online
<ol>
<li>GO_OFFLINE</li>
<li>GO_ONLINE</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Maintenance
<ol>
<li>REFRESH_ACLASS_HASHES &#8211; the system maintains two MD5 hashes for each persistent object
in order to detect changes to the field definitions (legal edits which create model mismatches)
and changes to key field definitions (illegal edits. Once created, key field names and data types
may not be changed). During system initialization and database rebuilds, the hashes need
to be refreshed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Developer Edits a Persistent object and the system detects that the edit invalidates
the coordination between the site model (the object) and the database (from saved archive).
<span class="caps">NOTE</span>: transitions only occur if there are entries in the database for the object under
test. This may not be correct for production environments, but I can&#8217;t think of a case
where it doesn&#8217;t work.
<ol>
<li>MODEL_MISMATCH_EDIT &#8211; an edit which changes a persistent object field definition:
field name, field data type, adds a field or deletes a field, but does not modify a key field</li>
<li>ILLEGAL_EDIT &#8211; an edit which modifies the name or data type of a key field of a persistent
object.</li>
<li>RESTORATIVE_EDIT &#8211; an edit which reverses either a MODEL_MISMATCH_EDIT or ILLEGAL_EDIT.
Typically will be a restore from a version control system. This action can be recognized
by the system if it fully restores the object definitions to the point where the hash
values match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Database Rebuild &#8211; momentarily invalidates the database
<ol>
<li>START_REBUILD</li>
<li>FINISH_REBUILD</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create Database Archive
<ol>
<li>CREATE_ARCHIVE</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>State</h2>

<p>State consists of the values of four database attributes (see
<a href="/doc.d/system-includes/dbaccess.html">dbaccess.php</a>), which are
expressed in various forms.</p>

<p id="state_names">The summary form is a string consisting of the values of all four variables,
in order, and separated by underscore (_) characters. For example, &#8216;T_F_T_F&#8217; &#8211; which is shorthand for <strong>(on line, archive not stale, database valid, no model mismatch)</strong>.</p>

<h3>State Variables</h3>

<ul>
<li>on_line &#8211; defines the accessibility of the site
<ul>
<li>F &#8211; site is Off Line. Used for creating archives, rebuilding database, and as
a safety state during development and site installation, re-installation, and upgrade</li>
<li>T &#8211; site is On Line &#8211; may be accessed and modified. Normal mode of operation.</li>
<li>R &#8211; Read Only &#8211; may be accessed, but not modified &#8211; except for certain specified tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>archive_stale &#8211; tracks database archive creation
<ul>
<li>F &#8211; archive is current &#8211; it&#8217;s safe to rebuild the database from the archive</li>
<li>T &#8211; archive is old and does not match database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>database_valid &#8211; is used while database is being rebuilt or does not exist
<ul>
<li>F &#8211; database is <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NOT</span></span> valid &#8211; cannot be used</li>
<li>T &#8211; database is valid and can be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>model_mismatch &#8211; tracks the comparison of the models in the <em>object</em> directories
[both site and system] with the object definitions in the current archive.
<ul>
<li>F &#8211; site code matches latest archive</li>
<li>T &#8211; mismatch between model and archive which can be corrected by database rebuild</li>
<li>X &#8211; mismatch between model and archive which <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CANNOT</span></span> be corrected by database rebuild</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>State Transitions</h3>

<p>The initial design attempted to simplify transitions by allowing only one state
variables to change at a time. This doesn&#8217;t work well because it becomes too
easy to interpose illegal states in a transition sequence which should actually
be an atomic transition consisting of several, simultaneous variable changes.</p>

<p>The current model simply defines a collection of legal transitions with associated
transition generating events.</p>

<h2>State Transitions:</h2>

<p>State transitions are defined using the tables below. Single transitions
may also be written using the &#8216;arrow&#8217; notation, as in &#8216;F_T_T_X -> F_T_T_F&#8217;,
which means what you think it means.</p>

<p>The left column is the invoking event. All possible events are listed.</p>

<p>The right column is the resulting state. It will hold the value &#8216;no&#8217;, meaning
the transition is not allowed; a state, as defined <a href="#state_names">above</a> ; or an augmented
state, as described in the next paragraph.</p>
