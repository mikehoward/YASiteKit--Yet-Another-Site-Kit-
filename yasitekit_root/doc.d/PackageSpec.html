<h1>Package The YASiteKit Package Specification</h1>

<p>A <strong>YASiteKit</strong> package is means to add functionality to a YASiteKit site. In Drupal parlance,
it is similar to a Module. In other systems they would be called &#8220;plugins&#8221;.</p>

<p>Packages are actually a collection of files in a subdirectory of <em>private_root/packages</em>
or <em>system_root/packages</em>. It doesn&#8217;t matter where they are placed unless the there
are more than one web site sharing the same system. In that case, site specific packages
should be in _private_root/packages__ and packages which are used in more than one
site &#8211; without any special modifications &#8211; should be placed in <em>system_root/packages</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>package</em> consists of the following files:</p>

<ul>
<li>an install file</li>
<li>one or more object files &#8211; these define <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5 objects which implement the data
structures and capabilities of the package.</li>
<li>one or more YATheme Template files</li>
<li>one <span class="caps">README</span>.txt file with the usual content. The content is plain text. All <span class="caps">HTML</span>
will be stripped and it will be displayed as preformatted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Packages are managed by the <a href="/doc.d/system-objects/Package.html">Package.php</a> object.</p>

<p>Package names must conform to a subset of camel case: The name must consist of words
which each begin with a capital letter and are then followed by one or more lower
case letters or digits. All words are concatenated together. In regular expression-esse,
they must satisfy &#8217;^([A-Z][a-z0&#8211;9]<ins>)</ins>$&#8217;.</p>

<p>Package directory names consist of lower case words joined by underscore characters (_).
For example, the &#8216;Foo&#8217; package will be in the directory named &#8216;foo&#8217;. The &#8216;FooBar&#8217; package
will bin the directory named &#8216;foo_bar&#8217;.</p>

<h2>The Install File</h2>

<p>It contains one or more RequestRouter initialization arrays which define the
routing to the Package&#8217;s capabilities. These connect specific paths to Package Template files.</p>

<p>The install file is always named <em>install.php</em>.
It must be valid <span class="caps">PHP</span>.
It must contain entries for the following variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>$install_data &#8211; array &#8211; an array of installation arrays</li>
<li>$required_packages &#8211; string &#8211; a comma separated list of required package names</li>
<li>$required_objects &#8211; string &#8211; comma separated list of required objects which are
not in a package. These are either system or site specific objects which just don&#8217;t
live in a package.</li>
<li>$management &#8211; array &#8211; is empty or either a Package initialization array. Only one
management script is allowed, so there can be only one initialization array</li>
</ul>

<h3>The $install_data Array</h3>

<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that the &#8216;foo&#8217; package has a template named &#8216;Foo.tpl&#8217;
which requires two parameters called &#8216;bar&#8217; and &#8216;baz&#8217;. Let&#8217;s also assume
it has a listing feature. Then the install file might contain:</p>

<pre>
$install_data = array(
array(
'routing_key' => 'foo',
'resource_name' => 'Foo Things',
'script_name' => 'Foo.tpl',
'path_map' => 'bar/baz',
'required_authority' => 'ANY',
'authority_field_name' => '',
),
array(
'routing_key' => 'foo_list',
'resource_name' => 'Foo Thing List',
'script_name' => 'FooList.tpl',
'path_map' => 'start_date/end_date',
'required_authority' => 'ANY',
'authority_field_name' => '',
),
);
</pre>

<pre>
// install_data for a package which provides function, but no visibility.
$install_data = array(
);
</pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>install.php</em> <em>must</em> define the variable &#8217;$install_data&#8217; as an array of arrays.</li>
<li>the <em>script_name</em> key value must be the file name of the script.
Scripts are expected to be in the <em>package</em> directory or somewhere else along the
include path. All scripts are processed by YATheme &#8211; which uses the YAThemeParser
object (defined in <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/athemer.html">athemer.php</a>). The YAThemeParser
knows how to find the script on the include path or in a subdirectory of one of the
packages directories. <span class="caps">NOTE</span>: Script names <em>must</em> be <em>unique</em> site-wide.</li>
<li>the <em>routing_key</em> must be unique in the system. It should be constructed with
the lower case version of the package name leading. Differing functions can
be indicated by appending words after the package name &#8211; conventionally separated
by underscores (_). (See examples above)</li>
<li>The following fields do not need to be defined because they have reasonable defaults:
<ul>
<li>required_authority &#8211;  defaults to &#8217;&#8217; &#8211; meaning anyone may access</li>
<li>authority_field_name &#8211; the name of the authority field within a record which
overrides the <em>required_authority</em> value in the RequestRouter record. Defaults to &#8217;&#8217;
which means that there isn&#8217;t one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The $required_packages Variable</h3>

<p>The required packages variable is simply a string containing a comma separated
list of package names. It must be present and empty if nothing is required.</p>

<pre>$required_packages = 'Foo, Bar';
</pre>

<pre>$required_packages = '';   // nothing required
</pre>

<h3>The $required_objects Variable</h3>

<p>A comma separated list of object names which are not in packages.</p>

<pre>$required_objects = '';  // nothing required
</pre>

<pre>$required_objects = 'Address';
</pre>

<h3>The $management Variable</h3>

<p>For a package which requires no management:</p>

<pre>$management = ''; or array(); or NULL; or FALSE
</pre>

<p>For a package which uses a single point of management, create a single
Package initialization array. The <em>resource_name</em> field may be omitted;
if omitted, it will named &#8220;package-name Management&#8221;, where package-name
is the name of the package.</p>

<p>The additional key <em>object_names</em> is a comma separated list of Object Names.</p>

<p><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: if an object is not named in a management initialization array, it is
presumed to be <span class="caps">UNMANAGED</span>.</p>

<pre>
$management = array(
'object_names' => 'Foo',
'routing_key' => 'manage_foo',
'resource_name' => 'Foo Management',
'script_name' => 'ManageObject.tpl',
'path_map' => 'object',
'required_authority' => 'X',
);
</pre>

<p>For a package which contains multiple objects which require separate management,
, create an array of Package initialization arrays.
The <em>resource_name</em> field may be omitted;
if omitted, it will named &#8220;package-name Management&#8221;, where package-name
is the name of the package.</p>

<pre>
$management = array(
array(
'object_names' => 'Foo,Bar',
'routing_key' => 'manage_foo_or_bar',
'resource_name' => 'Foo and Bar Management',
'script_name' => 'ManageFooBar.tpl',
'path_map' => 'obj_key',
'required_authority' => 'X',
),
array(
'object_names' => 'Baz',
'routing_key' => 'manage_baz',
'resource_name' => 'Baz Management',
'script_name' => 'ManageBaz.tpl',
'path_map' => 'baz_key',
'required_authority' => 'X',
),
);
</pre>

<h2>Package Object Files</h2>

<p>Objects in the package must be in files named for the name of the (primary) object
and with a &#8217;.php&#8217; suffix.</p>

<p>Thus, if a package encapsulates its data and functionality in an object called &#8216;Foo&#8217;,
the object must be defined in a file named &#8216;Foo.php&#8217;.</p>

<p>The only code in this file should be the code necessary to define the object.</p>

<p>There is no requirement that Foo be defined using AClass and AnInstance, but it&#8217;s
a good idea in order to interoperate with other objects and to gain the many of the
basic advantages of using YASiteKit.</p>

<p>By convention, YASiteKit objects and object files are named using &#8216;camel case&#8217;.</p>

<h2>Package Template Files</h2>

<p>Template files are used to create web pages. All template files end in &#8217;.tpl&#8217;.</p>

<p>See <a href="/doc.d/YAThemeSpec.html">YATheme</a> for details on the YATheme templating language
and how to construct template files.</p>

<p>There must be at least one template in order to create web pages for the package.</p>

<p>Template files have the following resources available to figure out what they are
supposed to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Globals::$router_obj &#8211; which is the RequestRouter object which was used to
locate them. See <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/requrest_router.html">requrest_router.php</a>
for details of the router object. Important attributes are:
<ul>
<li>routing_key &#8211; which should give a hint as to what <em>unique</em> <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span> got here.</li>
<li>required_authority &#8211; which lists 0 or more authority tokens. This is not normally
needed because authorization is handled by <a href="/doc.d/system-includes/render_tpl.html">render_tpl.php</a>
prior to the script getting control.</li>
<li>uri &#8211; will contain the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span> which got us to the site.</li>
<li>additionally &#8211; all tokens in the &#8216;path_map&#8217; attribute are used to create attribute which
hold their respective values or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FALSE</span></span> if not defined in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span>. (NOTE: you should use
the identity test for false, as in &#8217;$foo->bar === <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FALSE</span></span>)
For example, if <em>path_map</em> is &#8216;foo/bar/baz&#8217; and the <em>routing_key</em> is &#8216;marble&#8217;, then the
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span>&#8216;s beginning with &#8217;/marble/...&#8217; will be processed by this object. Examples of mapping:
<ul>
<li><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span></span>: $instance->map_pathinfo(/marble/1/frog/hopping) will generate attributes:
<ul>
<li>foo => 1</li>
<li>bar => frog</li>
<li>baz => hopping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span></span>: $instance->map_pathinfo(/marble/poodle) will also generate 3 attributes:
<ul>
<li>foo => poodle</li>
<li>bar => <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FALSE</span></span></span></span></li>
<li>bax => <span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">FALSE</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>Packages should be packed as gzipped or bzip2&#8217;ed tar files or zip files.</p>

<p>The root directory must be the package name directory so that when the archive
file is unpacked in <em>private_root/package</em> it will be ready to use in the system.</p>
